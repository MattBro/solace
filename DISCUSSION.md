## Assignment Tasks Progress

### Task 1: Fix Bugs and Anti-patterns
**Next to fix:**
- Implement proper error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Add comprehensive error handling for API calls
- Implement proper logging service instead of console statements
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Fix any memory leaks in useEffect hooks

### Task 2: Improve Design UI/UX
**Planned improvements:**
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Current table doesn't work well on mobile devices
- **Advanced Search**: Add filters for specialties, location, years of experience
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Improve spacing, typography, and color scheme for better readability
- **Loading States**: Add skeleton screens and loading indicators
- **Interactive Elements**: Add sorting on columns, clickable advocate profiles
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, add ARIA labels
- **Patient-Focused Features**: Add "book appointment" buttons, availability indicators
- **Search Experience**: Implement autocomplete, search suggestions, and "no results" states

### Task 3: Performance Improvements
**Planned optimizations (critical for "hundreds of thousands" of advocates):**
- **Backend Pagination**: Implement server-side pagination with cursor-based navigation
- **Database Optimization**: 
  - Add indexes on firstName, lastName, city, specialties
  - Implement full-text search for specialties
  - Add database query caching
- **Frontend Optimization**:
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
  - Add debounced search (reduce API calls)
  - Implement React.memo for advocate rows
  - Use React Query or SWR for data fetching and caching
- **API Improvements**:
  - Add response compression
  - Implement ETags for caching
  - Add rate limiting
  - Consider GraphQL for flexible data fetching

### Additional Improvements
- Add comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Add monitoring and analytics
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
