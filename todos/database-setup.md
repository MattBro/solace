# Database Setup Progress

## Current Status

**App Configuration**: Currently using mock data (no database required for basic functionality)
- The app returns default advocate data from `advocateData` array
- Database connection is commented out in `.env` and `/api/advocates/route.ts`

## Setup Tasks

### 1. PostgreSQL Installation
- [x] Check if Docker is running - Docker not installed, using Homebrew instead
- [x] Install PostgreSQL via Homebrew
- [x] Start PostgreSQL service
- [x] Verify service is running

### 2. Database Creation
- [x] Connect to PostgreSQL
- [x] Create `solaceassignment` database
- [x] Verify database exists

### 3. Migrations
- [x] Update drizzle-orm to latest version (required for compatibility)
- [x] Run `npx drizzle-kit push --force`
- [x] Verify tables created (advocates table)

### 4. Seeding
- [x] Run seed endpoint via curl
- [x] Verify data inserted (15 advocates added)

## Issues Encountered

### Issue Log

**Issue 1: Docker not installed**
- Docker command not found on the system
- PostgreSQL also not installed locally (checked via `which psql` and `brew list`)

**Options to proceed:**
1. Install Docker Desktop for Mac from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Install PostgreSQL locally via Homebrew: `brew install postgresql@16`
3. Use a cloud PostgreSQL service (e.g., Supabase, Neon, etc.)
4. Continue without database (app works with mock data)

**Resolution**: Installed PostgreSQL via Homebrew and successfully configured

**Issue 2: Database user mismatch**
- Initial .env used `postgres` user which didn't exist
- Fixed by using current system user (matthewbrooker) in DATABASE_URL

**Issue 3: Drizzle version mismatch**
- drizzle-kit required newer version of drizzle-orm
- Fixed by updating drizzle-orm to latest version (0.44.5)

## Summary

âœ… **Database setup completed successfully!**
- PostgreSQL installed and running via Homebrew
- Database created and migrations applied
- 15 advocate records seeded
- App can now use database instead of mock data
